     *  Each should be implemented using inheritance. They should all derive directly
     *  or indirectly from Shape (they are all Shapes). Note that a Square is also a
     *  Rectangle.
     * You should create .java files for each of your classes. You should minimize 
     *  code duplication. Start by checking out the Shape class. 
     * 
     * You are provided some code in main(...) to test out your classes. The provided
     *  code should compile when you are complete. 
     * 
     * When everything is working properly, your code should output the following...
     *    Rectangle(blue): area = 200.0, perim = 60.0
     *    Square(green): area = 225.0, perim = 60.0
     *    Rectangle(yellow): area = 78.5, perim = 31.4
